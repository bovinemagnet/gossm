= gossm
A simple tool to list AWS instances by profile, and then execute the aws session-manager connect command.

I needed a tool to utilise the `~/.aws/config` file to launch a session via  [AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/index.html) 
to an instance in the cloud.

Written in Go, this tool allows you to launch the aws cli ssm components.

if you do not set an environment variable for the `AWS_PROFILE` it will interigate the ones found in `~/.aws/config` and allow you to pick one.  Once the profile is set, it will get a list of the EC2 instances. 

usage:
* export AWS_PROFILE=profile_name gossm

You can further filter the list by specifying tag values, that will eb checked.

eg `gossm prd web` will look for machines tagged with both `prd` and `web` and present you a list of instances. 

NOTE: It does not check that the SSM agent is running on these instances.
